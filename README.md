## Introduction

Hi, I am currently attending the Deep Dive Bootcamp Java/Android as part of a career change.
I am highly motivated and always eager to learn new skills, I am also very adaptable and I think those qualities 
will help me succesfully navigate and graduate from this bootcamp.
I plan to look for employment in the android app development field as soon as I graduate.
